# HackDFW-2019
DFW FTW! (Dallas Fort-Worth For The Win!)
Winner : Dallas Regional Chamber: Say Yes to Dallas

What It Does:
After filling out a profile about their preferences and interests, our website will provide a city recommendation that fits them best. Users will also be provided with a map of various nearby points of interests in different categories.

How We Built It:
We used Google Open Authentication to help users save their profiles and be able to see their preferences again. Google Maps API was used to show the different points of interests that matched the user's preferences. The backend was built on SQL and the front end was built using PHP.
